<!-- INSPIRATION FOR PEACIFY -->

## ü§©What was our inspiration for 'Peacify' ?
* COVID-19 has impacted the lives of people around the world including children and adolescents in an unprecedented manner.In this backdrop one of the principal measures taken during lockdown has been closure of schools, educational institutes and activity areas. People started working from Home out of which the majority ones were IT Professionals . It becomes really tough to manage when it comes to working alone ,with such tiring work , which becomes a major reason neglecting health, especially mental wellness, gets affected. These inexorable circumstances which are beyond normal experience, lead to stress, anxiety and a feeling of helplessness in all.It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on children and adolescents. We were also one of its victims , the effect of Online Semester , Virtual Meetups, Online Classes and then loads of work to be done alone amidst such an unprecedented atmosphere.

* Unfortunately, the nationwide closures of schools and colleges have negatively impacted   over 91% of the world's student population. Absence of structured setting of the school for a long duration result in disruption in routine, boredom and lack of innovative ideas for engaging in various academic and extracurricular activities. Some children have expressed lower levels of affect for not being able to play outdoors, not meeting friends and not engaging in the in-person school activities .During lockdown we came across various cases of depression and there were also many suicide cases reported during lockdown. Sometimes even we also felt overwhelmed by emotions as it was also hard on us living away from our college friends and we are still going through the phase of online semester which has challenges of its own. 

* Hence, came up the idea of Peacify , which caters to the needs of our in person growth 
, emotional growth , promoting more of self realization , tracking our own feeling of mood, how we do feel , prevents us from having that hollow feeling inside us , encourages us daily , motivates us to start our day better than the previous one making us more closer to ourselves by the Power of Meditation. Making our Lockdown at our respective homes more fruitful , more of growth , more of getting connected with yourself.


<!-- CHALLENGES FACED -->
## ‚≠êWhat Challenges did we run into?
* Since we had only basic knowledge of android studio , it was our first complete app , where we got bugs , googled , learnt <br>
``` Got Bugs ?  , Google !! , Repeat  ``` was the major thing we learnt.

* The major challenge was dealing with the dynamic database of the app. The Journal Part was the trickiest part to handle to fetch from one activity , send to another , save it in a journal , and then finally you can save all your previous journal entries from the database.


<!-- MORE FEATURES ADDITION -->
## üíÅIf we had more time, what more features would we add to this project ?

* To identify the mood of the User by the words its entering particularly using the Machine Learning algorithms for Sentiment Analysis . This feature can be added to the part of Mood Tracer where the User enters about his day ,all his feelings about the day, and use these statistics to train a model detecting chances of him to need mental assistance from any friend or psychologist.
* To include more features that involve the user in physical activities like walking by adding the feature of a pedometer and making him evolve his physical strength step by step. Since, it's a fact that physical exercises make us feel light  and away from anxiety, tensions, sadness ,low and depression.
* To include the feature of notifying the closest and the favourite friends of the user whom he would have specified on registering over Peacify. This feature of notifying when the user is sad , feeling low , depressed, etc.
